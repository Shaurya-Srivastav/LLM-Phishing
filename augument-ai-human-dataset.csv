"Hi Abinav,
        
        I came across a recent paper that I believe would be of great interest to you.
        
        The paper titled 'Hyena Hierarchy: Towards Larger Convolutional Language Models' proposes a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention in Transformers called Hyena. It combines implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating to improve accuracy in recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens. The paper achieves Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K and is faster than highly optimized attention at longer sequence lengths. It sets a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets.

against using Red Hat that makes no sense at all.  I for one am GLAD that 
they 
a) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some 
sort of autodetection and changing crap)
b) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because 
formats have changed.Red Hat is not ""taking it easy"" on this, it's putting control in the hands

/home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use 
the same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the 
data as is.If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need 
to make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup 
and rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over 
ssh.  It's the best way to make backups.> These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! It's the other way around - your media files are backups of the CD's they 
came from ;)Good luck,

"Rohit was wondering what Microsoft's definition of a Chief Software
Architect is (and, consequently, what Microsoft thinks is a roadmap).
Here you go, from Mr. Ballmer to Mr. Gillmor to Mr. FoRK...
Architecture is war; love 'em or hate 'em, at least Microsoft
understands that: as Chief SA, BillG oversees all product strategy.""There are two things a road map can be. One is just a piece of paper
that tells what everyone is doing and records a bunch of bottom-up
plans. Or it can be something where we impose more broadly our vision
from the top. We are not going to try to get everything shared. ...
That's a path for getting everything stopped up. But at the same time we
are trying to take the top four or five things we are trying to do in
the Longhorn wave, Yukon wave, or the .Net wave and really have enough
time to have some cross-cutting discussions about how we make that happen.""""Bill [Gates] is dedicated full-time to being chief software
architect. He also happens to be chairman of the company, but he spends
most of his time being chief software architect. We have a body now that
meets every month -- the SLTT [Senior Leadership Technical Team],
basically the top people involved in the product-creating strategy --
and we present and discuss the issues. Bill is driving a process for
each of these waves. For instance, [he will ask] what are the
cross-cutting scenarios that I want, and then [he will] get all the
right product groups together and bring these things in front of the SLTT.""""People talk about what it takes to be a good manager, and people talk
about being a good coach and getting people to like you. In a large
organization those things are important, but at a certain level, ... the
most important thing you can do for your people to make them better is
to give them a framework where they can work in harmony with the other
people in the company. And from Bill's perspective, [this framework] is
the technical road map and the SLTT process; it is the scenarios. From
my perspective, it is the P&L [profit and loss] structure and the
multiple businesses because, given how we work, giving people a
framework that gets them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the
parts will mean we have better offerings.""http://www.infoworld.com/articles/pl/xml/02/07/22/020722plballmer.xmlBallmer in charge 
July 18, 2002 1:01 pm PTNO ONE KNOWS better than Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer that, as the .Net
platform evolves, the success of Microsoft depends on how well the
company coordinates its tool, server, and client strategies and how well
it communicates that vision. In an interview with InfoWorld Test Center
Director Steve Gillmor and InfoWorld Editor at Large Ed Scannell at
Microsoft Fusion 2002, Ballmer discussed the progress of .Net, changes
in the company's approach to product development, and Microsoft's
efforts to simplify product licensing and inspire trust in customers and
partners.> Last time we talked was two years ago, at the beginning of the .Net
> era. So where are we now in the .Net evolution?Let me start by talking about where I think we are in the XML revolution
first, and then [I will] talk about where we are with .Net. I believe
that the IT industry collectively decided over the last three or four
years that the world was going to be replatformed with XML as the key
foundation. It's not like anyone ever got together to decide this, but
it's like magnetic north, where it's been clearly indicated that
everyone is rallying around the concept. But I think the degree to which
[XML] is pervasive might still be underestimated. A lot of partners,
even at this conference, see it as b-to-b for big companies. But it is
really about the way software in general is designed. It is all about
the way security should work. Management -- everything is changed.So to answer your direct question, two years ago I might have said the
jury is still out about whether [XML] was going to happen. We were
questioning if it was going to be a legitimate competitor to Java. But
now the world has decided to embrace [XML] as the basis for the next
generation of technology. And there are a lot of benefits that come with
it. Could it have been something other than XML? Sure it could have. It
wasn't the specific technical implementation; it is merely the fact that
it comes out of Internet standards. It has deeper semantic abilities. It
is all about interoperability and connection.So in that context, where are we with .Net? I'll say a couple
things. No. 1, I would say we have some momentum in the market. We have
customers using the .Net product line, like Merrill [Lynch], Credit
Suisse, Marks & Spencer, CitiBank, and a variety of others. People who
are doing some things for real. I feel like the degree we are out front
is in some ways smaller and in some ways larger.> How so?Smaller in the sense that everyone is talking the XML talk, even Sun;
bigger in the execution sense: We've delivered. We delivered the first
batch of products that really were built XML to the core -- Visual
Studio .Net and BizTalk Server -- and we are getting traction. So I feel
good about where our execution is relative to everyone else. That is not
to say that other people aren't doing some reasonable bolt-on XML
support for the stuff they have.> You have some heavy lifting to do to convince your customers and
> partners to follow along. What do you have to do to set the standard
> for adoption and upgrading to this next generation?We have to present the picture that we are behaving consistently within
the framework of focusing on customer issues and customer satisfaction
and trustworthy computing, which we have articulated. Now there are some
things I would have done differently, in 20-20 hindsight. I would have
increased the focus on not just security but deployment, because a lot
of the security problems are actually deployment problems. We have the
fix, but sometimes we can't get the tools in their hands to deploy those
fixes fast enough. Licensing -- I know I would have given more time, and
there are better ways to plan around the kinds of changes we made. We
are still going to have to get smart about the full ramifications.> Do you expect any changes to be made between now and July 31 to
> Licensing 6.0? There is a lot of push-back on this.No, there is nothing that will happen between now and July 31. And we
will continue to learn over time what we need to do to earn our
customers' trust and earn their business. I think many of the people who
are pushing back really don't even know the new terms.> Isn't that your fault for not educating them?Yes, it is our fault. But you meet with plenty of customers whose
companies already have licenses, and they are saying, 'I think there's a
problem.' I don't deny there are some problems. I am sure there are some
issues we will have to work on over time.After July 31 we are going to see what the real issues are. I was
talking to a customer at the show who was saying he thought there would
be a problem, and I told him that we just completed a deal with his
company and that he is now universally licensed and that total costs to
his company are now lower than they were before. And he said, 'Oh really?'So we'll go through July 31. We have a lot of customers who have signed
licenses, and I am sure we are going to find some issues. My bigger
concerns today are probably not in the larger accounts, but there may be
some issues we need to address among the smaller-size companies, and we will.> How does the .Net initiative change the way in-house client and server
> developers work together? What we are trying to do for the health of .Net and the health of the
company and the sanity of the people who work there and the quality of
the products we produce is to have a more orchestrated, ï¿½ber-road map
of where we are going.Now there are two things a road map can be. One is just a piece of paper
that tells what everyone is doing and records a bunch of bottom-up
plans. Or it can be something where we impose more broadly our vision
from the top. We are not going to try to get everything shared. ...
That's a path for getting everything stopped up. But at the same time we
are trying to take the top four or five things we are trying to do in
the Longhorn wave, Yukon wave, or the .Net wave and really have enough
time to have some cross-cutting discussions about how we make that happen.Bill [Gates] is dedicated full-time to being chief software
architect. He also happens to be chairman of the company, but he spends
most of his time being chief software architect. We have a body now that
meets every month -- the SLTT [Senior Leadership Technical Team],
basically the top people involved in the product-creating strategy --
and we present and discuss the issues. Bill is driving a process for
each of these waves. For instance, [he will ask] what are the
cross-cutting scenarios that I want, and then [he will] get all the
right product groups together and bring these things in front of the SLTT.People talk about what it takes to be a good manager, and people talk
about being a good coach and getting people to like you. In a large
organization those things are important, but at a certain level, ... the
most important thing you can do for your people to make them better is
to give them a framework where they can work in harmony with the other
people in the company. And from Bill's perspective, [this framework] is
the technical road map and the SLTT process; it is the scenarios. From
my perspective, it is the P&L [profit and loss] structure and the
multiple businesses because, given how we work, giving people a
framework that gets them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the
parts will mean we have better offerings.> It seems the scenarios construct is really working for you. Is this an
> evolution of the solutions approach? I would say it is a pretty direct extrapolation from the solutions
stuff, only I think we are just getting a little more experience. I
think we use the word scenarios more often and solutions less, because
solution sounds more like a fixed thing. At the end of the day, most of
the things we do are customizable and programmable, and so people make
them into the solution they want. But they are still scenarios. What
will software deployment look like? Well, that is a scenario because it
involves Windows, Office, and other applications.We are working hard to make sure the whole is bigger than the sum of the
parts. That's not to say people are always comfortable with this. I
can't even say we will do it perfectly. All we have to do is do it a lot
better than we had been doing it. I think that would be a big step
forward for the customers.> Will this approach cut down on some of the technology civil wars
> Microsoft has had in the past involving who is going to gain control of
> a project? This seems to be a very democratic approach to development.I would not use the word democracy to describe it. People have to come
together and ultimately make some decisions. This is not a voting
process here, the agenda of what we think is important. We get a lot of
input. [But] once it is decided, people don't get to vote with their feet.We try to make a quantum leap here in terms of our ability to improve
pulling together all the pieces. Our customers want us to do
that. Simplifying concepts by unifying them. The customers don't say
they want us to do that, but when we do do that, they go, 'Ahhh, I get
it. That makes sense.'I don't want to go to six more meetings where people say, 'Is your
workflow strategy BizTalk?' ... Or 'What's your Office workflow
strategy?' Or 'Why is synchronization in some ways better for e-mail and
Outlook than it is for file folders and Web pages?'To get that sort of synchronization sometimes -- to get that high-level
road map to work -- you have to build something we don't have today. So
we have been talking about unifying storage. And so the best way to get
all this stuff to work is to get them all to work just one way. Then you
just keep tuning one set of parameters instead of having a thousand
flowers blooming.> In your Fusion keynote today, you talked about who your competitors
> are, and it was the usual suspects. But one you didn't mention is
> yourself. You are competing against the last generation of your technology.Always. Given that our stuff doesn't wear out or break down -- you can
question whether it breaks or not [Ballmer grins] -- but it doesn't
break down like machinery does. To get anyone to do something new, we
have to have something interesting and innovative.People think, OK, should we just do more upgrades or try to sell more
new product? We decided that users like us to do a level of systems
integration so they don't have to get involved in that. So take
Sharepoint Team Services, which we put in Office. We could have sold
Team Services as a separate product, and we could have introduced a new
SKU [stock keeping unit]. We could have decided if it should work down
level with the old Office or just the new version of Office, and we
could do that with real-time communications. But we tend to like to put
things together, integrate them, and then release batches?1202?-- which
are then 'upgrades' -- as a form of introducing our new innovation. But
no matter how you do it, because our stuff does not wear out, we have to
convince people that some idea we have is better or more powerful than
the older idea we had.And there are two aspects of doing that. One aspect is, on a given
product or upgrade release, does that make sense? Or do we convince you
that over an nyear period of time we will have enough innovation that
you will want to be licensed for that innovation. And this is part of
this whole licensing discussion we are having.We moved to the new licensing for two reasons, I would say. No. 1, we
wanted to simplify our licensing. When we look back a year from now, I
guarantee you that where we are now is simpler than where we
were. Nothing is simpler during a transition because they are learning
the new and are more familiar with the old, but I think people will
eventually realize this is simpler. Our licensing got pretty complicated
over the years, and some people came to not understand it all.The other issue is [the timing of delivering] our innovation. I don't
want to have a lot of rough questions [from customers]. So when we do
have new ideas, it's like, OK, should we put it in this upgrade or that
one or just have a stream of stuff that only our best customers have
access to under the terms of their contract? I think in the long run we
have a better chance of satisfying them with the latter than with
hitting them with six different upgrades. I am a fan of [letting] the
customer decide, OK, I want that piece or this piece. But they are
licensed for all of it. So those are the two things we sought to do.> That gets back to the trust issue, where if you front-load it, that's
> the big, lumpy upgrade; and if you back-load it with the vision, the
> .Net 2003 servers, you have a long gap in the middle where you have to
> sell into an untrusting audience.The truth is, we need to be better at both. There are some things you
can only do big and lumpy, like a new file system. It's not like some
sort of small user feature; if you change the file system, then the
storage, the backup, probaby those things are going to change. Probably
the shell ought to change.The applications ... a lot of things are going
to change. Can you call that lumpy? Or you can put out four new features
in PowerPoint, sure -- that would not look lumpy to users.I think we have to build trust in the model, and we are going to have to
deliver more over time. It will not come overnight. People will have to
see that we do a few things, ... that not all of our innovation is
lumpy, that more of it comes evenly and steadily. People develop a
confidence and faith; they like both aspects of the model. Over time,
our support needs to become more intimately involved in that story.We know that, but we don't know exactly what that means yet. And this
whole notion of software as a service -- this is not a licensing or
business discussion. It's how does software get rearchitected in the
world of the Internet? I mean, how many software products are
fundamentally different because of the Internet? Not many. Probably the
anti-virus guys keep up the best. They are always feeding new virus
support in. I asked the audience [at Fusion] how many use Windows
Update. Now that's a small piece of software, but it is big. That's the
consumer market; we've got to get that to really purr in the corporate market.> The lack of broadband build-out and adoption seems to be holding up
> the ability for users to take advantage of some new services you're
> talking about. When Bill [Gates] invested in Comcast cable, it
> triggered the Baby Bells to get on board with DSL. What are you doing
> now to deal with that issue?The No. 1 thing is, we have to make software that is so compelling that
people will start saying, 'Well, of course I am going to get broadband.'> And 802.11 is one of those compelling features?Yes, it is. I was in a hotel in Sun Valley, [Utah], this week that was
not wired. So I turned on my PC, and XP tells me there is a wireless
network available. So I connect to something called Mountaineer. Well, I
don't know what that is. But I have a VPN into Microsoft; it worked. I
don't know whose broadband I used. I didn't see it in Bill's room. I
called him up and said, 'Hey, come over to my room.' So soon everyone is
there and connecting to the Internet through my room.We have to support all the modalities, whether it is GPRS [General
Packet Radio Service] or 802.11. We have to make it easy to provision
from a software perspective for things that go on with DSL [and] cable
modems. ... And the software has to want a broadband link. There are not
many things you do where you say I really care about the performance. If
I am downloading PowerPoint files, then I want broadband. So when you
can do things with speed that you otherwise can't do without speed, that
is going to put a lot of pressure on the broadband community.That's the weird answer. The more normal answer is, yeah, isn't it
awful: There is not enough broadband, and the prices they charge ... . I
agree with all that. If you look at what happened in Japan recently,
there was a big drop -- it is now $25 a month for DSL. Vroom. They have
gone from almost no DSL connections a year ago to 1.5 [million] or 1.8
million [subscribers].> So how do we make that happen in this country?I think that is beyond us. If there is enough interest where the
consumers are looking intensely for broadband, whether it is at today's
prices or tomorrow's prices, that is going to shake out the
marketplace. And I think the marketplace will do a good job. We just
have to make it something obvious that consumers want. Now I happen to
live in a neigborhood where there is no broadband network. No DSL or
cable modems. Well, I have a neighbor, [Teledesic chairman and co-CEO]
Craig McCaw, who has a wireless network that I think I can piggyback off
of [Ballmer laughs]. So, yes, broadband is a bottleneck -- but I also
think we have to look at oursleves as a software industry and say,
'Aren't we, too, some of that bottleneck?' We have not built software
that makes broadband a must-have.> Microsoft CEO weighs in

----
aDaM@XeNT.CoM -- long .sig alert!I believe it is quite possible to productively apply both supposedly
incompatible approaches [REST & SOAP] together.  I'll sketch it out
below, both in prescriptive form.  Note: while this is proscriptive, it
is expected that local adaptations will be provided.1. Start by modeling the persistent resources that you wish to expose.
By persistent resources, I am referring to entities that have a typical
life expectancy of days or greater.  Ensure that each instance has a
unique URL.  When possible, assign meaningful names to resources.2. Whenever possible, provide a default XML representation for each
representation.  Unlike traditional object oriented programming
languages where there is a unique getter per property, typically there
will be a single representation of the entire instance.  These
representations will often contain XLinks (a.k.a. pointers or
references) to other instances.3. Now add high level methods which take care of all composite create,
update, and delete operations.  A key aspect of the design is that
messages for these operations need to be self contained - both the
sender and receiver should be able to make the absolute minimum of
assumptions as to the other's state, and multiple requests should not be
required to implement a single logical operation.  All requests should
provide the appearance of being executed atomically.4. Query operations deserve special consideration.  A general purpose
XML syntax should be provided in every case.  In addition, when a
reasonable expectation exists that query parameters will be of a
relatively short size and not require significant encoding, then a HTTP
GET with the parameters encoded as a query string should also be
provided.Implications  The following table emphasizes how this unified approach differs from
the ""pure"" (albeit hypothetical) different positions described above.1. Resource -- POST operations explicitly have the possibility of
modifying multiple resources.  PUT and DELETE operations are rarely
used, if ever.  GETs may contain query arguments.2. Get -- GETs must never be used for operations which observably change
the state of the recipient.  POST should be used instead.3. Message -- Do not presume that URLs are static, instead presume that
they identify the resource.  In particular, recognize that URLs can be
dynamically generated.  Expect URLs of other SOAP Resources in
responses.  Use the SOAP Response MEP for pure retrieval operations.4. Procedure -- Treat the URL itself as the implicit first parameter.
Allow URLs to be dynamically generated, and returned in structures.  Use
HTTP GET for retrieval operations.Conclusions  Looking to the future, the application level inter-networking protocols
that emerge today will likely be the application level intra-networking
protocols of the next decade.  Both REST and SOAP contain features that
the others lack.  Most significantly:REST - SOAP = XLinkThe key bit of functionality that SOAP applications miss today is the
ability to link together resources.  SOAP 1.2 makes significant progress
in addressing this.  Hopefully WSDL 1.2 will complete this important work.SOAP - REST = Stored ProceduresLooking at how other large scale systems cope with updates provides some
key insights into productive areas for future research with respect to REST.Finally, it bears repeating.  Just because a service is using HTTP GET,
doesn't mean that it is REST.  If you are encoding parameters on the
URL, you are probably making an RPC request of a service, not retrieving
the representation of a resource.  It is worth reading Roy Fielding's
 thoughts
on the subject.  The only exception to this rule that is routinely
condoned within the REST crowd is queries.  -- Sam Ruby, http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/07/20/restSoap.html

"Hi all
I have a prob when trying to install Linux (tried RedHat, Suse) on my
laptop. I can start the install but after about 2min, the whole pc just
dies.
I know it's not a Linux prob and here is what I have encountered:I had the same problem when installing Win on it and eventually sorted it
out by disabling the infrared port. I'm guessing this might be same prob
although I'm not sure. I am very new to Linux so it's not that easy for me
to work it out. I did manage to follow the setup procedure at one stage
(using images on disks) and it cuts out either as it's trying to verify what
CD-Rom I have or just after (hence my suspicion of the infrared port again).can anyone help ?thanks

"2002 ea budget with enw budget update / suggestions : piper , richter , and webb met with whalley this saturday for a few hours on overall enrononline strategy and budget . we showed him the development completed to date and the general development list going forward . we also showed him the down time report as well as some growth numbers over the last 12 months . we also explained a few of the commercial objectives going forward . finally , we showed him the same suggested eol budget plan we showed you , including 2001 plan vs . 2001 forecast vs . 2002 plan as well as the allocation methodology . greg is generally ok with the total 2002 plan number for eol ( $ 37 . 7 million fully loaded with bonus , indirects and depreciation ) , why we want that money and where it would be spent . what he did not like was the allocation methodology , which is currently cost based and based on development and products . he suggested a charge that included a fixed fee plus a product setup fee plus a product maintenance fee plus a per transaction charge , etc . richter and webb are researching that and will try to see if it will work . i think you and i can agree the $ 37 . 7 million is good for 2002 but we still need to agree on your part for ea . the current cost based suggestion for ea for eol for 2002 is about $ 22 million . a question is , will you and lavo accept any charges for 2002 for eol based on transactions ? sheriff also has the entire eol suggested budget and his part . we meet eim and egm today on their total enw charges . on operations , the current suggested 2002 ea charge is $ 44 . 7 million , which is also a fully loaded number and is slightly down from 2001 forecast ( sally and bob and i can explain that in detail this week ) . what i would like to do is agree between you and i that you will accept that as eas budget number for 2002 plan for operations . what we still need to work on is how we would possibly bill that in some fixed and variable form that includes transaction counts . on infrastructure , the current suggested ea plan number for 2002 $ 40 . 9 million . this is down from 2001 forecast . this does not include the $ 10 . 5 million of controllable expense you budget directly for ea . the issue left here is what is eas headcount , what is the headcount in it development and what is the server infrastructure charge related to it development that would effect the ea number . on the first issue , we have the ea headcount as represented by hr . the current ea infrastructure charge assumes that complete number . it is larger than the number you have . you have requested we deal with some of that additional headcount differently since ea can ' t bill out those on a fully loaded basis . we will work with wes and his team on that today and tomorrow to come up with a plan . on it development , the current suggested 2002 plan expense number for ea , fully loaded , is $ $ 44 . 5 million vs . a 2001 forecast of $ 34 . 4 million . also , the 2002 suggested capital number for ea is $ 50 . 1 million vs . a 2001 forecast capital number of $ 50 million . the question is , what did you get for your $ 84 . 4 million in 2001 and what would you get for $ 94 . 6 million in 2002 ? first , mark and sally and i met on sunday and we want the 2002 plan numbers to be down from 2001 forecast . what we need to do in the next three days is finalize what are the critical maintenance and new development projects for 2002 for ea . our team is bob hall , mark pickering ( mark will call on stock and perlman and rao and hotte as he sees necessary ) and greg piper with pickering having the final say for enw . can you tell me who you want from your side ( story ? belden ? ) to work with us three over the next few days until we agree ? we want to work on it around the clock until it is at least approximately right . your thoughts ? gp greg piper president & ceo enron net works llc _ _ _ _ _",0

itself is not using it?
I don't think you should worry too much about someone travelling out of 
the hive, but again, I'm curious as to how the driver actually modifies 
the keys on the server.> (2) The risks of a compromise to the client (far more likely).  This

open for something nasty here.
Two other things spring to mind; 
1) If anyone can modify the key, how do you make sure that two users are 
not overwriting the same key, thereby causing undesirable effects.
2) If anyone have permissions to write to the key (and below), anyone can 
create thousands of extra keys under this key, thereby filling up the 
registry. The result of such a thing is obvious.If I got this all wrong, I'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell 
me where I might have misunderstood.

 Dear Readers,Your ISP, if it's anything like mine, works like a very large
boat: It moves slowly, it turns slowly, and sometimes it leaks.
Take rogue wireless networks, for example. For many months now,
some mischievous entrepreneurs have been hacking into major ISP
networks and siphoning off bandwidth for neighborhood wireless
networks. Only now, months later, are broadband bigwigs doing
something about it. And what
about ISP hackers? Could they break into your service provider?
Probably. Thankfully, you can protect yourself against most of
these leaks. Let Dan Tynan, our ISP guru, show you how. Quick links to Services & Prices from these companies

This week in Internet ServicesBig broadband providers are ticked off about Wi-Fi hot spots.
In fact, both AT&T Broadband and Time Warner Cable have begun
campaigns to stop subscribers from sharing their accounts with
others at no charge. Also this week: we review Yahoo""s new
dial-up service.
Is your ISP safe from hackers?Surely, the folks who run your ISP have thought good and hard
about security issues, but should you count on their skills to
ward off intruders? Not wise, says our ISP expert. In this
week""s column, Dan Tynan takes security matters into his own
hands and shows you how to protect yourself.Domain namesA domain name provides an online identity and contact point for
your business, organization, or project. Almost every transaction
on the Internet relies upon a domain name to conduct commerce,
display Web pages, deliver e-mail, and more. Secure your own
domain here.Comcast shareholders bless AT&T dealComcast shareholders on Wednesday approved the cable television
company's $27 billion purchase of larger rival AT&T Broadband,
which will create the nation's largest cable TV operator with
more than 22 million customers.

interact with each other when I set up ntp on my system while connected
to the net. However, I didn't realise that Windows altered the hw clock
as there was no mention of it in any of the docs I read. 
I still dual-boot on a regular basis and if Windows is sneakily messing
with the clock, I'd be interested to know in what way it is and how it
couild be stopped from doing so. Everything seems to work fine since I
set the system up but I still don't like to have these gaps in my
knowledge.Regards,

Tech shores up Homeland DefenseComputer security is becoming an increasingly critical part of President Bush's 
proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally proposed the department 
last month, he never mentioned the Internet or cybersecurity. But as Capitol Hill 
scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting about tech-savvy terrorists--and 
insisting any new agency must shield the U.S. from electronic attacks as well.

"accuracy of historical reconstruction in writing in linguist 5 . 1393 on another topic , martinha @ fub46 . zedat . fu-berlin . de ( martin haspelmath ) says : ) it is true that latin syntax could hardly be reconstructed from ) modern romance languages , but neither could latin morphology , and ) even the view of latin phonology that we would get from romance is ) very distorted . our reconstruction of protolanguage grammar is ) always imperfect . . . in looking at historical reconstruction done for s . american languages ( largely phonological ) , i ' ve often wondered about this . just how much could we trust the reconstructions that we did ? one of my rules of thumb for those languages was that if an item was longer than one syllable , it was suspect as being polymorphemic , and if it was longer than two syllables it was almost certainly polymorphemic . the problem is that most attempts at reconstruction ignored this areal phenomenon ( sometimes because the data was simply unavailable ) . from what i know of romance languages , i would say polysyllabic morphemes are more common there . if anything , that should make it easier to reconstruct latin , since you have more to work with . ( of course , the morphology of romance languages is much better known than that of the languages of s . america , which also helps ! ) so if latin would be very imperfectly reconstructed , what hope is there for native american languages ? has anyone ever attempted , as an exercise in the comparative method , reconstruction of latin from the romance languages , then compared the results with the real thing ? or reconstruction of any other attested language from its descendents ?",0

rebuilt for Valhalla). Then you upgrade to Psyche using the Red Hat CDs.
Hopefully with the compat libraries the package will still be there
(although I doubt that since C++ is binary incompatible, so this is
probably a bad example), then you ""apt-get update"" with the new Psyche
repository... and there's where the problem will be : It will say that
there are two synaptic-0.24-fr1 packages (one installed, the other
available) with the same version but different dependencies :-/
That's why I always keep package versions lower for older distributions.Matthias--

"acl ' 99 theme final cfp final call for theme proposals acl-99 conference : the 37th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics university of maryland june 22 - - 27 1999 the association for computational linguistics would like to encourage the submission of papers on substantial , original , and unpublished research on all aspects of computational linguistics . a particular aim for the 1999 conference is a broadening of both the thematic coverage and geographical origin of submissions ; to this end , we are experimenting with a new format . some proportion of the conference will be given over to special sessions , somewhat like a special issue of a journal , organised around themes proposed by members of the nlp community . our aim is to incorporate some of the intensity and excitement of the traditional post-conference workshops , without replacing those workshops - - - we expect , as has become traditional , that there will also be a set of post-conference workshops that will remain separate from the main meeting . this call invites proposals for thematic sessions in accordance with the considerations below ; a final call for papers will be sent out in early november . what is a thematic session ? we are soliciting proposals for themes that will provide 4 - - 8 high quality papers , typically forming one or two sessions in the main conference . proposers of accepted themes , who will become the chairs of those sessions , will have similar responsibilities to those of workshop organisers in terms of arranging reviewing and the delivery of camera ready copy ; however , the papers will be scheduled as part of the main sessions and will be published as part of the main conference proceedings . in terms of subject area coverage , we expect thematic sessions will be closer to workshop topic areas in focus . format of theme proposals please specify the following : - - chair details : name , address , email , telephone number , fax - - title - - summary : at most one page describing the proposed subject area , citing evidence that there is sufficient interest in the area to generate enough high quality submissions to populate up to a half-day 's worth of presentations . - - proposed review committee : each paper submitted should be reviewed by at least three people . as part of your proposal , you should suggest a potential review committee of around 12 people who will be asked to serve on the committee if the proposal is accepted . your list should demonstrate the spread of interest in the area in the community , encouraging both international participation and the participation of a broad range of researchers , including both senior members of the community and graduate students . theme proposals should be submitted to the email address provided below . informal enquiries as to what might work as a theme can also be directed to this address in advance of the submission date . possible themes might be topics like : nlp and data mining ; word segmentation in asian languages ; reconciling functional and formal approaches to syntax ; approaches to concept to speech . we provide these examples only as indications of the variety of topic areas that will be considered . important dates this call issued : september 14 , 1998 theme submissions deadline : october 12 , 1998 notification of selected themes : october 26 , 1998 call for papers : early november 1998 paper submissions deadline : january 25 , 1999 notification of acceptance : march 22 , 1999 camera ready papers due : may 3 , 1999 general submission questions chairs for the acl-99 program are ken church and robert dale . all queries regarding the program should be sent to acl99 @ mri . mq . edu . au ; this forwards to both authors . submission format theme proposals should be of approximately two pages in length , ideally submitted in ascii by email to acl99 @ mri . mq . edu . au with the subject : "" acl99 theme proposal "" . more complicated formats such as standalone latex ( not requiring additional style files ) , postscript , and word will be accepted if they print on the first try . hardcopy proposals should be faxed or mailed to * both * of the chairs , clearly labeled "" acl99 theme proposal "" . proposals should be received by 5pm gmt on october 12th 1998 . ken church ( co - chair ) robert dale ( chair ) at&t labs - research microsoft research institute 180 park ave , office d235 school of mpce po box 971 macquarie university florham park , nj 07932-0971 , usa sydney nsw 2109 , australia kwc @ research . att . com robert . dale @ mq . edu . au tel : + 1 973-360 - 8620 tel : + 61 2 9850 6331 fax : + 1 973-360 - 8077 fax : + 61 2 9850 9529",0

"Thank you for your interest!Judgment Courses offers an extensive training
course in ""How to Collect MoneyJudgments""If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney
Judgment debt . For every Judgment that is paid, 5more
Judgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year . Some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars .Your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.  
You have the video opened doors for me in the future. 
There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states 
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: ""I am now making $2,000.00 per
week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now""After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.Please call us at 1-281-500-4018.We have Service Support staff available to you from 8:00am to
10:00pm (Central Time) 7 days a week . If you callthis number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.Thank you for your time and interest.+++++

"propose they rename it ""Charlie Heston High"" and maybe the students will learn to take AR-15s with extended military-spec scopes and .223 high-velocity ammo and start plinking innocent civilians at random in the suburbs of Washington. That's far more effectual than blowing oneself up in a bus.In America these days, it seems that violence ascribed to any political doctrine foreign to Bushism is vile and repugnant. But random violence is entertainment and intrigue.A couple of ex-FBI ""consultants"" speaking on the shootings in DC were quoted as saying the shooters, presumed to be a pair, were getting a ""heroin-like high"" from each successful kill and that they ""for whatever reason decided to level the playing field, thumbing their nose at law enforcement and society.""See?

"see if this doesn ' t interest you . . . . read the 1st paragraph ! if you are convinced that this is not for you , then delete it . my bet is that you will be intrigued enough to finish reading it before you make your decision . financial success brochure dear fellow advertiser : my name is tim brody and i make a living selling a recipe for potato cheese pierogies . this is all i do , and i earn in excess of $ 100 , 000 each year . incredible you say ? now , i am revealing my secret to you . incredible , you say ? it is completely legal and , you too , can be well on your way to earning $ 100 , 000 per year by selling your product , plans , recipe or information through the mail . before i reveal my plan to you , let me tell you a little about myself . five years ago , i placed a classified ad in a food magazine to earn a little extra money . my response was 11 orders and 43 "" get rich quick "" schemes . now , please don t laugh , over the next three years i tried all of those "" get rich quick "" schemes . some actually met with success while many met with complete failure . with each try , i learned something new about marketing my product . finally , this plan came together and in the first 3 months , i made over $ 25 , 000 . after i tried it again , i earned $ 35 , 000 and it became clear to me that i was on my way to financial freedom . now please , this story is not merely to brag . i want you to realize the hard work , persistence and expense that went in to making this program a success . it is also my way of teaching others the problems of many marketing plans , and , hopefully , they will be able to avoid many of my own mistakes and expenses . this program is not for everyone . if you are planning to make a million dollars or to compete with your fellow participants , then this plan is not for you . however , if earning $ 100 , 000 a year in a stress-free program interests you , please read on , you are among the sincere people needed to make this program a success . maybe you have participated in some of those "" get rich quick "" programs before . you probably were dissatisfied with your response rate from the classifieds or mailings ? were you expecting to receive additional income but didn t even receive enough responses to pay for the ad or the stamps ? if you are like others , the answer is yes ! please do not give up hope just yet . there is a way to make money and have fun , as well as fine tune your culinary taste . join a network of buyers and sellers with similar goals for no additional costs . the process is called multi - level marketing and it is not illegal . ( see section 18 , title 1301 , 1302 & 1342 of the us postal and lottery code . ) it is a modified plan similar to that of companies such as tupperware and mary kay . best of all , it can earn advertisers like ourselves , thousands in a few months . what exactly is multi-level marketing ( mlm ) ? mlm requires that you send letters to fellow advertisers ( we will help you with the addresses ) asking that they buy your product with the understanding that once they do , they will be included as a member of your program . ( just as tupperware or avon requests salespeople to buy their products to "" show "" to their customers . ) the letter you send always has your name on it along with 2 - 8 advertisers . it is based on this premise : ( assuming a 3 member list and a 100 % response ) level # 1 - you send out 20 letters with your name in the # 1 position . 20 people reply . level # 2 - those 20 replies send out letters with your name in the # 2 position . 400 people reply level # 3 - those 400 replies send out letters with your name in the # 3 position . 8000 people reply . you receive a total of 8 , 420 replies and are unable to receive more , because once your name reaches the bottom of any list , it is eliminated and replaced by new members . if you asked for $ 10 for your product , you earn $ 84 , 000 . of course a 100 % response rate is unrealistic , instead expect between $ 35 , 000 and $ 60 , 000 . now , before you decide that this is the dumbest thing you have ever heard of and decide to throw this away , please look at the statistic : 91 % of all classified advertisers join one or more of these programs . why ? because they are sincere in wanting to make money ! otherwise , they would not have advertised in the beginning . knowing this fact , i know that you would like to read on . by now , you have received many letters of this type . this alone should prove that these programs are working . do me a favor , save this and all of the other letters . when you have the time , sit down and compare all the programs . your financial success depends on your making the best choice . if you are like most newcomers , your first instinct is to join the program that offers the most money or offers the cheapest price per product . before you do this , i ask that you think and answer the following questions about each program : 1 . how many participants are on the list ? the more names there are , the more responses you will need . an average 8 person list requires 1 , 500 , 000 responses before obtaining $ 100 , 000 for each participant . a 3 member list needs 3 , 500 responses . 2 . how much do i receive per product ? if you join a $ 2 . 00 plan , know beforehand that you will need 5 times the amount of replies as a $ 10 . 00 program . the $ 2 . 00 plan will also take 6 months longer for you to receive big money , obviously because you need more responses . 3 . do the words cheat-proof and monitored appear on the plan ? if the program is based on honesty and integrity alone , it will fail . face it , when it comes to money , very few people can be honest . cheat - proof means that there is a way to insure that every member gets paid . whereas monitored means that members are watching to make certain that the list never gets altered . this can be done ! also know that you are receiving many $ 2 . 00 plans , not because they are popular , but because the members must keep resending information to meet their goals . . . only 6 % of all advertisers join $ 2 . 00 programs . you probably have received only a few $ 5 and $ 10 programs . these plans work ! there is no need to send hundreds of letters and monitoring is effective . 4 . how much money do i want to earn , and how much is my initial investment ? if you want to earn $ 50 , 000 for example , know that you need 25 , 000 $ 2 . 00 responses . when you figure your investment , make sure it includes printing and stamps . if a plan will not accept checks , it is not legitimate . finally , narrow your choices and choose the best program to suit your needs . hopefully , you will see that , like 76 % of us , this one is the best choice . our program this is a cheat-proof 3 - level plan . we pay $ 10 for the product of each member on the list . you will only be required to send out 20 letters ( how to get names is supplied ) and your total investment is $ 40 ( including postage and printing ) . you only need 4 replies throughout the entire program and you ve lost nothing ! plus , we offer a bonus plan in which you can earn $ 20 , 000 more with no extra effort ! your earnings are based on the 3 - step plan outlined in the prior page . if we receive a 100 % response rate , we can all earn $ 84 , 000 ! of course , a 100 % participation again , is unrealistic . members are reporting $ 35 , 000 - $ 60 , 000 within 2 months ( without the bonus plan ) . how do i join ? on the bottom of this page , write your name , address and product , as you want it to appear on this mailer . please print clearly . make 3 copies of the following information that includes 1 ) other participants , 2 ) your name , address and product and 3 ) the control number . wrap a $ 10 check , money order or cash inside of each copy and send one to each of the following people with a self-addressed , stamped envelope . keep the original for your tax records ; it is a legitimate business expense . do not cheat by sending out only one payment . only 1 of the 3 has the required information you will need to proceed . within days , you will receive your products , instructions and this mailer with your name listed as one of the three participants . you will then send out 20 of these mailers to others . within a week , you will begin to receive your money , and within 4 weeks you will have earned over $ 25 , 000 ! it s that easy ! join today ! 1 . j . dolbow 2089 waterbury se kentwood , mi 49508 ( sweetish no - names ) 2 . l . shock 7438 sawmill rd . # 458 columbus , oh 43235 ( amy s famous chicken ) 3 . s . butler po box 770074 coral springs , fl 33077-0074 ( delicious potato salad ) your name _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ your address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city , state , zip _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ your product _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ control number 187329 * your total cost for this program is $ 40 . 00 ( $ 30 . 00 to members , $ 3 printing , $ 7 stamps ) . there are no other fees . * canadian residents ask that you please remember to use 2 first class stamps when mailing to them . believe me , the extra stamps are worth it . they are some of our best participants ! * if paying by check , please allow 7 additional days to allow the check to clear . important information to ensure that you keep this legal and honest , be sure to file schedule c profit or loss from business with your income tax return . report all income you receive and deduct all business related expenses . these tax deductible business expenses can include vehicle ownership ( in your company s name ) , expenses , travel and entertainment , business equipment , purchases for your business , supplies , telephone , postage , advertising costs , rent , wages ( other than your own ) , legal and professional services , and business taxes . these can be legally deducted if they are related to your business . ( consult your tax professional for details ) . because you are buying and selling products and services , and reporting your income for tax purposes , this type of direct marketing / ordering is not in the chain letter category . if no product or service is sold , then it does become a chain letter and is in violation of the law . note : after joining , if you would like a new laser camera ready copy of these pages , with your name , address and control number in the proper place , send a copy of this brochure and $ 5 . 00 towards our costs of doing this to : d r enterprises , 2089 waterbury se , kentwood , mi 49508 . we will send them to you flat , not folded .",1

"nonreferential np 's in english in a number of lgs ( roviana and yup ' ik eskimo being the two in which i have encountered this ) , nonreferential np 's are phonologically and / or morphologically / syntactically incorporated into the vrb / verb phrase / verb group . are there any similar structural clues which could be used to identify nonreferential np 's in english ? my interest is in identifying nonreferential np 's in written english so that a computer natural lg processing system would know not to set up referents for them to serve as antecedents for subsequent anaphora resolution . compounds ( e . g . duck-shooting season ) can i suppose be treated superficially as single words , but what about things like ' lose faith in ' , ' catch sight of ' . of course , some criteria will involve larger discourse issues , but it may be that it is possible to identify at least some nonreferential np 's "" cheaply "" , i . e . just by looking within a clause and / or considering inherent lexical semantics . i will summarize and post any replies to this list . regards , simon corston .",0
"hi all,thanks for the good information on the choice of phones, pda choices.as an aside i also saw that 3com have released a usb blootooth dongle. 
that in a lptp combined with a 6310i with the blootooth (with HSCSD) 
might be a nice thing to have (if they work!)
i'm doin up a little doc, so if anyone is interested i'll post my findings.cheers!mit bestem,Bernardino

"James> This is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail,

as I consider it brain damage in the extreme, Sun inherited this from AT&T.James> Get your mail administrator to add the ""E"" flag to your sendmail.
James> This means you will never see a line beginning with ""From "". Any such

starts with ""Mlocal"" such as:[4784] grep ^Mlocal /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
Mlocal,         P=/usr/lib/mail.local, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@qPSXfmnz9E, S=EnvFromSMTP/HdrFromL, R=EnvToL/HdrToL,
[4785] and make sure that 'E' appears in the long list of flags following ""F="".
If your sys-admin uses m4 to generate sendmail.cf, and any good sys-admin
should, then here is the magic line for the .mc file:MODIFY_MAILER_FLAGS(`LOCAL', `+E')dnlJames> You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of 
James> letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool.  This avoids
James> the whole issue.  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time,

as slocal, which is part of the [n]mh distribution) do the trick just as well.-- John_______________________________________________

"western update 5 / 7 / 01 executive summary ? the likely outcome of the 16 may elections is a victory by the bc liberal party ( currently holding polls at 70 % ) , a pro - business , right - of - center party led by gordon campbell . ? major changes in british columbia energy policy are likely under a liberal government . ? a low snow pack , a return to regulation by the bc utilities commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed by us power consumers could force bc hydro to stop out - of - province power sales once existing contracts expire ? bc hydro ' s additional generation at williston is likely undeliverable liberal party platform ? income tax cut that would make bc ' s income tax the lowest in canada ? independent audit of the province ' s books amid allegations of ndp mismanagement and incompetence ? review of all crown corporations ( including bc hydro ) to enhance efficiency and management quality ? campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the corporate capital tax , the machinery equipment tax and the corporate income tax . energy agenda according to sources , under the liberal party ' s rule , significant changes in the bc government ' s energy policy could include a move toward the privatization of some bc hydro assets , perhaps including its transmission assets , as well as increased government support for independent power producers and coal - fired production . at the same time , a rate review and attempts to establish a broad electricity strategy for the province could lead to a lack of clarity about the province ' s overall energy strategy over the next few years . campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and of expanding coal - fired production . campbell calls thermal coal , "" an asset that we want to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in bc . "" a high - ranking ndp source believes that campbell will take the province back along the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting new technology . the source expects this to lead to strong protests from environmentalists . "" these are confrontational moves , and people will be on the streets . "" campbell ' s most likely choice for energy minister is richard neufeldt , though we caution that this decision depends on the make - up of the legislature after the election . neufeldt is responsible for the liberal party ' s energy , mining and northern development portfolio . sources speculate that if right - wing liberals are dissatisfied with the party ' s performance after the may election , neufeldt could again defect to the opposition . however , this gives campbell even greater incentive to name neufeldt energy minister , a high - profile position . should the liberals win the election , gordon campbell has indicated that he would return bc hydro to regulation by the bc utilities commission . the bc government has derived $ 5 . 5 billion in revenue from bc hydro since 1991 ( roughly 85 percent of its profit ) . critics say this has undermined the utility ' s ability to pay down approximately $ 7 . 5 billion in debt and invest in the future . this also has left hydro without a rate stabilization fund , something that sources feel may be needed this year . campbell reportedly intends to address these issues , and one can expect this to lead to calls for change . electricity export policy currently the bc utilities commission is demanding more information about bc hydro ' s out - of - province sales . the commission has warned that , given the low snow pack , the utility could be a net importer of power this year . supporting this view , the northwest power planning council , representing bc hydro ' s key trading partners in the us , has said that it would not be able to rely upon british columbia or alberta during peak consumption periods over the next few years , and that its customers face a 25 percent chance of not making it through the winter without power losses . the combination of a low snow pack , a return to regulation by the bc utilities commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed to bc hydro by us consumers may force bc hydro to stop out - of - province power sales once existing contracts expire . bc hydro privatization a key campaign energy issue for the liberal party is the privatization of bc hydro . campbell has urged greater electricity competition , saying , "" we need to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all , producers and consumers , on an equal and non - discriminatory basis . "" he stated that independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn . "" i want to change that big time , "" he told the canadian institute of energy . campbell also urged more natural gas development , including pipelines and co - generation plants . campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by ndp leader ujjal dosanjh . campbell stated on 25 april , "" we have no intention of selling bc hydro ; we have no intentions of selling their transmission lines , no intention of selling their dams , we have no intention of selling their reservoirs . "" liberal party spokesman mike morton also reiterated on 29 april that bc hydro would not be for sale . a high - level ndp source commented that campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regarding bc hydro , essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams , transmission lines or generating stations , but that he is in favor of opening the sector up to competition . however , local sources believe that some parts of bc hydro might be sold as part of an overall review of bc crown corporations to enhance efficiency . likely sale prospects include bc hydro ' s distribution channels and its energy trading subsidiary , powerex . in addition , gary farrell - collins , the liberal finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister ( after neufeldt ) , has stated that public ownership of bc hydro ' s non - core businesses , such as westech , its systems division , and customer billing , could come under review . bc hydro williston generation current reservoirs levels at bc hydro ' s williston hydro - generation facility are at 2 , 150 ft , which allows bc hydro to drop levels another 35 ft ( 170 gwhs / ft ) under their current permit . the one drawback to this plan ' s additional generation involves the mackenzie pulp mill that would have to cease operation if water levels were to fall below 2 , 140 ft . sources close to the minister of mines & energy - elect , richard neufeldt , indicate that levels at williston probably will not be drawn down below mackenzie ' s operational limits due to concern over political backlash .",0

to spread FUD about the viral nature of the GPL to make CEO/CIO level people
(often not the most technically clueful, even the CIOs) fear that if they so
much as use a Linux box, as, say, a print server, they'll have to make their

jsut said, but that was the tenor of the remarks). And their marketing
budget is a tad bigger than yours or mine.Niall--

"california power 1 / 19 / 00 1 . legislation passes - short - term measures , very long - term measures as we said yesterday , sb - 7 x passed the california state senate easily . the bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the department of water and resources until february 2 nd . the department will have $ 400 million available to finance power purchases , but there expectations that these costs could easily rise to $ 1 billion by next week . ab - 1 x has evolved into a longer - term solution and in its current form , would authorize the department of water and resources to enter into long - term contracts ( as opposed to the 15 day contracts in sb - 7 x ) to buy power at a price cap of 5 . 5 cents per kw / h . this legislation is not expected to pass today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week period covered by sb - 7 x , when negotiations between generators , the utilities , and the state are likely to resume . a second piece of legislation under - - sb 6 x - - has created uncertainty in the markets . this legislation will create a california public power authority with bond issuance authority . the uncertainty concerns whether the new authority will address the problem of the $ 12 billion in outstanding debt owed by the utilities . the current text of the legislation focuses only on longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving efficiency . yet the legislation also says "" the authority may issue bonds , exercise power of eminent domain , and enter into joint power agreements and buy , own , and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a project . "" the general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of either issuing bonds to finance past debts , or using eminent domain or the bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a ch . 11 proceeding . 2 . default update 3 . bush as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate little interest in getting involved",0

>    but let's walk before we run - after all, we may end up
>    all using Zodb in any case :-)I'd like this (despite the additional installation burden - we can ship
binaries for Windows and Mac) and not only for technical reasons.  As I
understand it, post-1.8x versions of the core bsddb code ship under the
Sleepycat license, which demands that projects using it must be
published-source.  This is a problem if we want Spambayes to be fully
PSF-licensed - if someone wants to take the Spambayes source and fund their
addictions by creating a commercial, closed-source spam-filter product, the
PSF license allows that but not if the code relies on bsddb.  Not that I'm
in favour of people making money from Spambayes (unless it's me 8-) but the
PSF license does allow for it - it should be all or nothing.  Or do I have
this all wrong?Slightly OT: This has concerned me since PLabs announced that they were
integrating bsddb into Python 2.3 - it's going to make it very easy
(especially on Windows) for someone to write code that uses anydbm, wrap it
up with Py2exe and ship it under a commercial license, not knowing that
they're breaking the Sleepycat license.  They've never heard of Sleepycat
Software or even bsddb - as far as they're concerned, this ""bsddb.pyd"" file
that Py2exe tells them they need to ship is just another part of Python,
like _socket.pyd or select.pyd.--

"Mr.Vincent Nnaji,
 Standard Trust Bank Ltd,
 Lagos,Nigeria.
 Dear Sir,
 I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.
Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. 
On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 
According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.
 I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 
This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. 
Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. 
Thanks and Regards,
 MR.VINCENT NNAJI.",1

"An apparent quote from Dubya, from the Times (sent to me by my Dad):http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-43-351083,00.html------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TONY BLAIR's special relationship with George W. Bush is under
considerable strain. Not only do the two disagree on Yassir Arafat's
tenure as leader of the Palestinian Authority, but Blair has started
telling disparaging anecdotes about the President.Baroness Williams of Crosby recalled a story told to her by 'my good
friend Tony Blair' recently in Brighton. Blair, Bush and Jacques
Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of
the French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided in
Blair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.'

"This is the problem, it's not the people who buy the machine that
end up installing on it.We're actually investigating switching from Sparc/Solaris to 
Intel/Linux. I would much prefer to be using Linux at work
so I'm pushing for this. It definately doesn't help when 
you're given a bog standard Dell box and linux won't work
with the graphics card on it.At the moment at work, if we want a new workstation, we just
buy whatever Sun's latest system is, we jumpstart it, and 
that's it, it's up and running.
Basically the whole installation procedure is
""boot net - install""
This is exactly what you need when you are administering a large
group of workstations. You don't have the time to check dells
website every time you want to buy a machine, you'd spend
your life on Dells website and messing around with drivers
and compiling new versions of X. That's fine if you've got
one machine at home, hey, I've done it myself, but
when working with a large bunch of systems, it's impossible.

"" questions were raised last week on wall street after the company announced a write - down of more than $ 1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses . the disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23 pc . yesterday they fell another $ 5 . 30 ( # 3 . 80 ) to $ 20 . 75 in early trading . according to the annual report the "" related party transactions "" , as enron describes them , took place in 1999 and 2000 , resulting in losses of $ 16 m and $ 36 m respectively . mr lay said that auditors approved the deals , but would not give further details of what they were . they are understood to have been hedging transactions against enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment jp . "" we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , "" added mr lay . the relationship between the investment losses and the sec probe is not clear , though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions . enron owns teesside power station and wessex water in britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the us . investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company ' s credit rating . an enron spokesman said mr fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion . the sec inquiry is "" informal "" , says the company . the watchdog contacted enron last wednesday , the day of the results announcement . the sec declined to comment . enron made a loss of $ 638 m in the third quarter , its first in over four years . copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial desk shares of enron plummet 21 % energy : sec requests information from company on series of unusual financial deals tied to executive . nancy rivera brooks times staff writer 10 / 23 / 2001 los angeles times home edition c - 1 copyright 2001 / the times mirror company shares of enron corp . set a 52 - week low monday on word that the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the houston - based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive . enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , said it had voluntarily provided information on "" certain related - party transactions "" that had been previously disclosed to the sec . "" we welcome this request , "" said kenneth l . lay , enron chairman and chief executive . "" we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest , "" he said . the sec request is the latest in a parade of bad news for enron , which has seen investments sour in telecommunications , retail electricity sales and water . investors have battered the company ' s stock , which once sold for nearly $ 85 a share in the last year , and many have criticized enron ' s stingy meting out of financial information . but several wall street analysts remain upbeat on the stock , noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn . in august , enron chief executive jeffrey k . skilling , one of the main architects of the company ' s strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit , stunned wall street by resigning . skilling cited personal , family - related reasons , but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company ' s stock price contributed to his departure . on monday , enron shares plunged $ 5 . 40 , or nearly 21 % , to close at $ 20 . 65 on the new york stock exchange . enron ' s stock has lost nearly 40 % of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third - quarter loss of $ 618 million after $ 1 . 01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments . but the charge also included $ 35 million related to what enron described only as the "" early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity . "" in a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings , the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions . but investors were stunned when stories last week in the wall street journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by andrew s . fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer , and that enron had whittled $ 1 . 2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $ 1 . 2 - billion note it had received from the partnership . shareholder equity now stands at $ 9 . 5 billion . the limited partnership , called ljm 2 , and fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved enron assets and stock , the journal reported . lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed . a shareholder lawsuit charging that enron ' s directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in texas state court . many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes , but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them , analyst say . investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that enron has guarded financial information , making it difficult to analyze the company ' s complex web of businesses . and many are not confident that all the bad news has been released . analyst m . carol coale , who follows enron and other energy companies for prudential securities in houston , downgraded enron to a "" hold "" from a "" buy "" rating monday out of such frustration . coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of enron . but bob christensen , energy analyst with first albany corp . , said that despite enron ' s recent difficulties , the bulk of the business remains strong . "" i continue to tell investors that 70 % of this company ' s business is growing at a 26 % rate , and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on , "" he said . investors are panicking because of a "" bad news story that doesn ' t reflect reality , "" said jon kyle cartwright , senior energy analyst with the raymond james copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .",0

"new book : cognitive linguistics the new psychology of language cognitive and functional approaches to language structure edited by michael tomasello , emory university the history of psychological approaches to the study of language has included periods of little communication between the disciplines of linguistics and psychology , and periods where each field drew upon the theories and methods of the other in limited - - and often limiting - - ways . this book represents a new approach that may define the next era in the relationship between psychology and linguistics . it does so by presenting the evolving linguistic theories collectively known as cognitive - functional linguistics in terms that are intended to be accessible to cognitive scientists interested in how language works psychologically . in contrast to the chomskian linguistic theories with which most psychologists today are familiar , the cognitive-functional approach of these linguists focuses on the things people communicate about ( communicative functions ) and the social conventions by means of which they do so ( linguistic symbols and structures ) . the chapters in this book were all written by linguists who are leading proponents of this approach and edited by a psychologist committed to bringing this new way of looking at language into the mainstream of psychology . the volume promises to give psychologists a new appreciation of what this variety of linguistics can offer their study of language and communication , as well as to provide cognitive-functional linguists new models for presenting their work to audiences outside the boundaries of traditional linguistics . 0-8058 - 2576 - 2 [ cloth ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 65 . 00 0-8058 - 2577 - 0 [ paper ] / 1998 / 312pp . / $ 29 . 95 lawrence erlbaum associates , inc . orders @ erlbaum . com",0

Date: Not suppliedSince the AmphetaDesk source code is so easily modifiable on any platform, I've 
been seeing some interesting hacks and modifications lately. The most powerful 
of them is l.m. orchard's newest template[1], which provides an insane amount 
of new features, including hiding old items, click counting, and an outline 
based format. More than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a 
selectable template in the next version (AmphetaDesk v0.94). Also of interest is Brian Cantoni's FTPStore[2]: _""FTPstore is a slight 
addition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve 
the personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back 
to the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep 
your saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and 
at work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in 
sync.""_ It's a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines.[1] http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000228.phtml

and maybe a new kernel (and grub, but I have long before put those to

"begin forwarded text To: rah@philodox.com Subject: Internet Defamation Suit Ends With Defense Verdict Date: Mon, 5 Aug 2002 10:08:41 -0400 (EDT) From: SomebodyInternet Defamation Suit Ends With Defense Verdicthttp://www.law.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/View&c=LawArticle&cid=1028320303259&t=LawArticleTechJohn Council Texas Lawyer 08-05-2002In one of the first trials in the country to address Internet defamation, a Dallas County, Texas, jury last week rejected a $700 million suit by an Internet company that claimed it was harmed by negative electronic messages posted by an employee of a competing company.ZixIt, a Dallas Internet company, filed ZixIt Corp. v. Visa International, et al. in 1999, alleging it was harmed by Paul Guthrie, then a vice president with Visa. ZixIt alleged in its suit that Guthrie posted more than 400 anonymous messages, many of them negative, about ZixIt on the Yahoo Finance ZixIt Internet message board, causing ZixIt's stock price to drop.The suit also alleged that the postings destroyed the company's ability to market its ZixCharge Internet transaction authorization system, which allows consumers to make purchases without revealing their credit card numbers to merchants. Visa has a similar Internet payment system.ZixIt alleged that the postings caused its stock price to plummet. Had the product been successful, the company believed it would have been worth more than $1 billion, according to lawyers involved in the case.On July 31, a jury in Judge Merrill Hartman's 192nd District Court found that ZixIt's product was not harmed by the postings.Neal Manne and Kenneth McNeil, lawyers from Houston's Susman Godfrey who represented ZixIt at trial, did not return calls for comment by press time.""The company hasn't made any decision about an appeal,"" says Cindy Lawrence, a ZixIt spokeswoman. ""The outcome of the lawsuit doesn't have any effect on our future products and services in e-messaging.""GETTING GRADEDVisa's lawyers alleged that Guthrie acted on his own and had a right to free speech, and that Guthrie's Internet postings had no effect on ZixIt's stock. Guthrie has since left Visa, lawyers for the company say. Guthrie was not a defendant in the case. However, his interests in the case were represented by Todd Noonan, an attorney in Sacramento, Calif.'s Stevens & O'Connell. Noonan was recovering from surgery last week and was unavailable for comment.""I think people believe whether you succeed or fail [is] because of what you do and not what other people do to you. Internet companies didn't succeed for all sorts of reasons,"" says Jeff Tillotson, a partner in Dallas' Lynn, Tillotson & Pinker, who defended Visa at trial.ZixIt's case was a hard sell to the jury, especially with the reality of the economy, Tillotson says.""Everyone knows that the stock market has fallen and the trouble with Internet companies. I think the jury took that into account,"" Tillotson says.There were lessons to be learned from the Internet defamation trial, says Mike Lynn, who also represented Visa at trial. Even though message boards are considered a protected form of free speech, that freedom won't prevent a company from being dragged into court if its employee blasts another company on the Internet, Lynn says.""A company can be responsible for what an employee posts on a message board,"" Lynn says. ""The courts have said you're entitled to go to a jury to determine whether there are damages as a result of that. The law is very odd, not mature, [and] damage theories are not mature.""The nature of the case also added an interesting twist to the trial, Tillotson says. Many of those who posted messages on the board attended the trial and posted comments about the daily proceedings throughout the three-week trial, he says.""It was apparent to everyone that many of the people who posted on these message boards were watching the trial,"" Tillotson says. ""It really was wild. The lawyers felt like they were being graded.""-- --- end forwarded text -- ----------------- R. A.

"" the ops "" corrective action order "" was issued late wednesday , after el paso officials had been saying for most of the day it was only a matter of hours before at least one of the lines was back in operation . one industry source said testing could easily take three weeks to a month , even if no repairs are necessary . the ops order directs el paso to : 1 ) conduct hydrostatic pressure testing of the lines ; 2 ) perform a direct assessment of the integrity of the pipelines by both x - ray and ultrasonic examinations ; and 3 ) because internal corrosion has been detected in the failed section of the pipeline , el paso also must submit a corrective action plan to ops identifying all areas on the approximately 330 miles of pipeline that may have internal corrosion . even if el paso passes all these tests and ops allows it to return to service , each of the three lines will be subject to a 20 % pressure restriction , according to coyner . the restriction will be reviewed in 10 working days , and may be removed upon the receipt of more information about the factors that contributed to the aug . 19 explosion . ops has the authority to take other actions if warranted . the ops yesterday issued the seven - page corrective action order , which permits it to suspend or restrict the operations of a pipeline , after it determined that the el paso lines were hazardous . el paso has been notified of the order , and it has 10 days to request a hearing to be held in either houston or washington dc . if el paso fails to comply with any part of the order , it could face civil penalties of up to $ 25 , 000 a day , and the case could be referred to the u . s . attorney general for "" appropriate relief "" in the u . s . district court , according to stacey gerard , associate administrator for pipeline safety . preliminary investigations of ruptured line 1103 by the ops and the national transportation safety board ( ntsb ) indicate that "" significant internal corrosion was visible on the failed section . internal corrosion may have been a contributing factor in the line failure . the possibility of internal corrosion on other lines in the area is a safety concern . "" the ops order applies to the 30 - inch line 1103 , which incurred the most damage , and the parallel 26 - inch line 1100 that "" sustained an undetermined amount of damage at the pecos river crossing due to the fire . "" it also covers the adjacent 30 - inch line 1110 , whose damages are still undetermined . lines 1103 and 1110 were built in 1950 , and line 1100 in 1947 . within 90 days , el paso will be required to submit to the ops southwest region director an "" analysis of the continued safe operation "" of the three lines "" based on the testing and inspection required under this order . "" in related action . rep . john dingell ( d - mi ) , who has been a sharp critic of ops for its allegedly lax handling of pipeline safety violators , is in the process of drafting a letter to the agency to determine whether its failure to take aggressive action towards pipelines may have created an atmosphere that led to the tragedy on el paso . - -",0

"chechen who are the chechen ? johanna nichols university of california , berkeley author 's note : i have been doing linguistic field work on chechen and its close relative ingush for many years . though i am not an ethnographer or historian , i have tried to bring together here some general information about the chechen people and their language in order to increase public awareness of the people and their situation , and to put a human face on a people of great dignity , refinement , and courage who have paid heavily for their resistance to conquest and assimilation . this paper may be copied freely . if you disseminate it electronically or print it out yourself ( which you are welcome to do ) , reformatting ( font , spacing , etc . ) is ok but please do not edit it . johanna @ uclink . berkeley . edu fax : 510 642-6220 phone ( 510 ) 642-2979 introduction . the chechens and their western neighbors the ingush are distinct ethnic groups with distinct languages , but so closely related and so similar that it is convenient to describe them together . the term "" chechen "" is a russian ethnonym taken from the name of a lowlands chechen village ; "" chechnya "" is derived from that . ( both words are accented on the last syllable in russian . ) this term evidently entered russian from a turkic language , probably kumyk ( spoken in the northern and eastern caucasian plain ) . the chechens call themselves nokhchi ( singular nokhchuo ) . similarly , "" ingush "" is not the self-designation but a russian ethnonym based on a village name ; the ingush call themselves ghalghay . demography . 1989 census figures : 956 , 879 chechen ; 237 , 438 ingush . the chechens are the largest north caucasian group and the second largest caucasian group ( after the georgians ) . location , settlement . the chechen and ingush lands lie just to the east of the principal road crossing the central caucasus ( via the darial pass ) , extending from the foothills and plains into alpine highlands . the lowlands enjoy fertile soil , ample rainfall , a long growing season , and a small oilfield . neighbors to the east are the various peoples of daghestan ( many of them speaking languages related to chechen ) ; in the plains to the north , the turkic - speaking kumyk and ( as of the last three centuries ) russians ; to the west the ingush and to their west the ossetians , who speak a language of the iranian branch of indo - european ; to the south ( across the central caucasus range ) the southern ossetians and the georgians . there are two true cities in chechen and ingush territory : grozny ( pop . about 400 , 000 until 1995 ) , the modern chechen capital founded as a russian fort during the russian conquest of the caucasus ; and vladikavkaz ( pop . about 300 , 000 ; known as ordzhonikidze in soviet times ) in the ingush highlands at the ingush - ossetic territorial boundary , also originally a russian military fort and founded to control the darial pass . nazran in the ingush lowlands was traditionally and is now a large and important market town . the cities had substantial russian and other non - chechen - ingush population ; vladikavkaz was mixed ingush and ossetic with significant numbers of russians and georgians . ( groznyj has now been destroyed and mostly depopulated by russian bombing . vladikavkaz and the adjacent ingush lands were ethnically cleansed of ingush in late 1992 . ) all russian governments - - czars , soviets , post - soviet russia - - have used various means to remove chechen and ingush population from economically important areas and to encourage settlement there by russians and russian cossacks ; hence the mixed population of the cities and lowlands . language . the caucasus has been famed since antiquity for the sheer number and diversity of its languages and for the exotic grammatical structures of the language families indigenous there . this diversity testifies to millennia of generally peaceable relations among autonomous ethnic groups . chechen and ingush , together with batsbi or tsova - tush ( a moribund minority language of georgia ) make up the nakh branch of the nakh - daghestanian , or northeast caucasian , language family . there are over 30 languages in the northeast caucasian family , most of them spoken in daghestan just to the east of chechnya . the split of the nakh branch from the rest of the family took place about 5000-6000 years ago ( thus the nakh - daghestanian family is comparable in age to indo - european , the language family ancestral to english , french , russian , greek , hindi , etc . ) , though the split of chechen from ingush probably dates back only to the middle ages . the entire family is indigenous to the caucasus mountains and has no demonstrable relations to any language group either in or out of the caucasus . like most indigenous caucasian languages chechen has a wealth of consonants , including uvular and pharyngeal sounds like those of arabic and glottalized or ejective consonants like those of many native american languages ; and a large vowel system somewhat resembling that of swedish or german . like its sister languages chechen has extensive inflectional morphology including a dozen nominal cases and several gender classes , and forms long and complex sentences by chaining participial clauses together . the case system is ergative , i . e . the subject of a transitive verb appears in an oblique case and the direct object is in the nominative , as is the subject of an intransitive verb ( as in basque ) ; verbs take no person agreement , but some of them agree in gender with the direct object or intransitive subject . 97 % or more of the chechens claim chechen as their first language , though most also speak russian , generally quite fluently . chechen and ingush are so close to each other that with some practice a speaker of one has fair comprehension of the other , and where the two languages are in contact they are used together : a chechen addresses an ingush in chechen , the ingush replies in ingush , and communication proceeds more or less smoothly . chechen was not traditionally a written language . an orthography using the russian alphabet was created in the 1930 's and is used for various kinds of publication , although for most chechens the chief vehicle of literacy is russian . traditionally , as in most north caucasian societies , many individuals were bilingual or multilingual , using an important lowlands language ( e . g . kumyk , spoken in market towns and prestigious as its speakers were early converts to islam ) for inter-ethnic communication ; any literacy was in arabic . russian has now displaced both kumyk and arabic in these functions . particularly if the chechen and ingush economies continue to be destroyed and unemployment and mass homelessness continue to undermine the social structure , there is danger that chechen and ingush will be functionally reduced to household languages and will then yield completely to russian , with concomitant loss of much of the cultural heritage . history . the chechens have evidently been in or near their present territory for some 6000 years and perhaps much longer ; there is fairly seamless archeological continuity for the last 8000 years or more in central daghestan , suggesting that the nakh - daghestanian language family is long indigenous . the caucasian highlands were apparently relatively populous and prosperous in ancient times . from the late middle ages until the 19th century , a worldwide cooling phase known as the little ice age caused glacial advances and shortened growing seasons in the alpine highlands , weakening the highland economies and triggering migrations to the lowlands and abandonment of some alpine villages . this period of economic hardship coincided with the russian conquest of the caucasus which lasted from the late 1500 's to the mid - 1800 's . in all of recorded history and inferable prehistory the chechens ( and for that matter the ingush ) have never undertaken battle except in defense . the russian conquest of the caucasus was difficult and bloody , and the chechens and ingush with their extensive lowlands territory and access to the central pass were prime targets and were among the most tenacious defenders . russia destroyed lowlands villages and deported , exiled , or slaughtered civilian population , forcing capitulation of the highlands . numerous refugees migrated or were deported to various muslim countries of the middle east , and to this day there are chechen populations in jordan and turkey . since then there have been various chechen rebellions against russian and soviet power , as well as resistance to collectivization , anti-religious campaigns , and russification . in 1944 the chechens and ingush , together with the karachay - balkar , crimean tatars , and other nationalities were deported en masse to kazakhstan and siberia , losing at least one-quarter and perhaps half of their population in transit . though "" rehabilitated "" in 1956 and allowed to return in 1957 , they lost land , economic resources , and civil rights ; since then , under both soviet and post - soviet governments , they have been the objects of ( official and unofficial ) discrimination and discriminatory public discourse . in recent years , russian media have depicted the chechen nation and / or nationality as thugs and bandits responsible for organized crime and street violence in russia . in late 1992 russian tanks and troops , sent to the north caucasus ostensibly as peacekeepers in an ethnic dispute between ingush and ossetians over traditional ingush lands politically incorporated into north ossetia after the 1944 deportation , forcibly removed the ingush population from north ossetia and destroyed the ingush villages there ; there were many deaths and there are now said to be up to 60 , 000 refugees in ingushetia ( about one-quarter of the total ingush population ) . in developments reminiscent of today 's invasion of chechnya , in the weeks leading up to the action the ingush were depicted ( inaccurately ) in regional media as heavily armed and poised for a large-scale and organized attack on ossetians , and the russian military once deployed appears to have undertaken ethnic cleansing at least partly on its own initiative . ( my only sources of information for this paragraph are russian and western news reports . helsinki watch is preparing a report for publication in early 1995 . ) the invasion of chechnya presently underway has meant great human suffering for all residents of the chechen lowlands , including russians , but only the chechens are at risk of ethnic cleansing , wholesale economic ruin , and loss of linguistic and cultural heritage . religion . the chechens and ingush are sunni muslims of the hanafi school , having converted in the late 17th to early 19th centuries . islam is now , as it has been since the conversion , moderate but strongly held and a central component of the culture and the ethnic identity . economy , customs . traditionally , the lowlands chechen were grain farmers and the highlanders raised sheep . at the time of russian contact the lowlands were wealthy and produced a grain surplus , while the highlands were not self-sufficient in food and traded wool and eggs for lowlands grain . chechen social structure and ethnic identity rest on principles of family and clan honor , respect for and deference to one 's elders , hospitality , formal and dignified relations between families and clans , and courteous and formal public and private behavior . kinship and clan structure are patriarchal , but women have full social and professional equality and prospects for financial independence equivalent to those of men . academics , writers , artists , and intellectuals in general are well versed in the cultures of both the european and the islamic worlds , and the society as a whole can be said to regard both of these heritages as their own together with the indigenous north caucasian artistic and intellectual tradition . social organization . until the russian conquest the chechens were an independent nation with their own language and territory but no formal political organization . villages were autonomous , as were clans . villages had mutual defense obligations in times of war , and clans had mutual support relations that linked them into larger clan confederations ( which generally coincided with dialects ) . each clan was headed by a respected elder . there were no social classes and no differences of rank apart from those of age , kinship , and earned social honor . select bibliography anonymous . 1992 . ethnic cleansing comes to russia . the economist , november 28 , 1992 , p . 60 . blanch , lesley . 1960 . the sabres of paradise . new york : viking . comrie , bernard . 1981 . the languages of the soviet union . cambridge : cambridge university press . conquest , robert . 1970 . the nation killers : the soviet deportation of nationalities . london : macmillan . critchlow , james . 1991 .

"minority languages in context * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * minority languages in context diversity and standardisation congress to be held in chur ( switzerland ) , 21st - 23rd september 1998 provisional program themes addressed by the congress the aim of the congress is to stimulate the study and discussion of contextual dimensions within which minority languages are spoken , shared and taught . the congress will provide a forum for the exchange and discussion of descriptive and comparative reports from a variety of regional and national settings including those in switzerland . the contexts within which minority languages evolve can be described from differing points of view along a continuum between two opposing poles . at one end of the continuum lay attempts to achieve stability and homogeneity which are usually articulated through projects aiming at the planning and normalisation of minority languages in order to present these codes as having equal status to adjacent majority languages . at the other end of the continuum we find destabilisation and heterogeneity observable at points of contact and overlap between minority and majority languages and often leading to hybrid forms which challenge traditional notions of linguistic code . these two poles involve a variety of actors and agents of differing social and institutional status , all exercising varying degrees of influence on the language situation in question . the congress will address three thematic areas highlighting the full range of this continuum . thematic area one : standardisation of minority languages thematic area two : minority and majority languages : coexistence , relationships and overlap . thematic area three : minority languages at school * * * * * * * congress events * * * * * * * * * * * * keynote speakers florian coulmas ( tokyo ) for theme 1 ; bernard poche ( grenoble ) and ben rampton ( london ) for theme 2 ; mehandra verma ( york ) for theme 3 . * * * * sessions the thematic development of each day will be provided by speakers reporting on data and research from numerous and diverse linguistic situations around the world . titles of contributions e . agurtzane ( eusal herriko unibertsitatea ) , compensatory linguistic strategies in the gradual death process of a minority language : evidence from some dying dialects of basque m . auzanneau ( paris 5 ) , pluralit et dynamiques socio-culturelles et linguistiques saint - louis du sngal r . bernardi ( spell urtiyei ) , spell - standardisierungsprojekt der ladinischen idiome in den dolomiten d . bradley ( la trobe ) , standardisation of transnational minority languages in asia : lisu and lahu r . cathomas ( fribourg ) , spracherhaltung und immersion ?

Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today
By Michael E. AngierThis is my list. They're the ones I've selected for my life at
present. Consider them suggestions for yourself--ideas to 
help you generate your own top ten list. By getting clear 
on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be 
moving toward and experiencing your highest and best.
1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for
which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will
have even more to appreciate.2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize 
how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. 
EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly 
imagine.3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and 
drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more 
calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.5. Read something educational, inspirational or
entertaining--preferably all three.6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the
Super-conscious.7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of 
my book, then write in my journal.9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful, 
magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.Bonus Step: Make something work better -- 
Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

no    19%Comments:
~~~~~~~~~No. This is a funny thing to me.  I hear about so many 
people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, 
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address 
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.  We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and 
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do 
who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person 
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy 
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that 
person (me) would have her account info and could write 
a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send 
it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her 
to tell me what the difference was between the original check 
and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never 
heard back from her.  The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is 
available in many places.  Have a good day.
--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html
~~~~~~~~~Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, 
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most 
importantly, never give any personal information at a site 
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar 
or a Veri secure sign or others. Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put 
in my credit information in each time instead of having 
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks 
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet 
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is 
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web 
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!
--  Catherine F.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com 
~~~~~~~~~Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that 
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner 
was in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address 
went unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; 
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com 
address to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building 
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place 
on 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I 
lost a minimum of $50,000.  
 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first 
time I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often 
enough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet 
theft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals 
and should spend years behind bars.
 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft; 
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by 
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

 Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Todayï¿½ï¿½This is my list. They're the ones I've selected for my life at
present. Consider them suggestions for yourself--ideas to
help you generate your own top ten list. By getting clear
on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be
moving toward and experiencing your highest and best.
Â 
1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for
which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will
have even more to appreciate.
2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize
how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it.
EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly
imagine.
3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.
4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and
drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more
calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.
5. Read something educational, inspirational or
entertaining--preferably all three.
6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the
Super-conscious.
7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.
8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of
my book, then write in my journal.
9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful,
magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.
10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.
Bonus Step: Make something work better --
Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

No. This is a funny thing to me.Â  I hear about so many
people being super scared to give out their SS#.Â  Well folks,
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.Â  Give me a name and address
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.
We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.Â  They could do
who knows what with the CC number.Â  I once had a person
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that
person (me) would have her account info and could write
a check out for thousands of dollars.Â  I told her to just send
it to me then and she said that was OK.Â  Then I asked her
to tell me what the difference was between the original check
and a fax copy.Â  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.Â 
Never
heard back from her.
The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is
available in many places.Â  Have a good day.

Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However,
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most
importantly, never give any personal information at a site
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar
or a Veri secure sign or others.
Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put
in my credit information in each time instead of having
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!

Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner
was in a bad car accident.Â  I had a full service account.
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address
went unprotected.Â  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees;
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com
address to a porn shop.Â  Thus, I lost 4 years of building
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place
on 8 more.Â  This set me back about 4Â  months: I believe I
lost a minimum of $50,000.
Â 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.Â  The first
time I lost almost 4 months of work.Â  Now, I back up often
enough to not to lose so much time.Â  This is also Internet
theft.Â  These people are nothing but out and out criminals
and should spend years behind bars.
Â 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft;
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.Â  I sell only by
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

Forwarded by: Gary Williams A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a 
short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex 
life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard 
from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The 
card said nothing but ""Maxwell House"".  Mom was puzzled at first, but 
then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: ""Good till 
the last drop."" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, 
and the card read: ""Benson & Hedges"".  Mom now knew to go straight to 
her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 
""Extra Long, King Size"".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still 
happy for her daughter. The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for 
a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a 
whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky 
handwriting were the words: ""British Airways"".  Mom took out her latest 
Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, 
and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: ""Three times a 
day, seven days a week, both ways."" Mom fainted.

 July 11, 2002						--Janice Chen,						editor in chief,						CNET Reviews
 Dear readers,It was a crushing blow to discover that Vindigo, my
all-time-favorite Palm app, was no longer free. Twenty-five bucks
wasn't steep, but the principle of paying for a former freebie
was hard to swallow. Not that hard, though; surprising
myself--and my fellow cheapskates--I've discovered that I'd
rather dish out the dough than go Vindigo-free myself.That's what Web-based e-mail providers are banking on. Now that
most of us have gotten sucked in by those gratis Web e-mail
accounts, most ""free"" Web e-mailers have started charging for
premium services or imposing strict limitations on free accounts.
Read our reviews 
of the four top services to see what you get if
you dish out the dough (or not)--and which to avoid if you want
to stay spam-free.Surfacing on this week's Buzz Meter is another free-gone-fee app.
The latest version of the popular file-sharing software BearShare
now offers a paid version that lets you search and download
without those annoying ads. Maybe the best things in life are now
those with a fee.

Yahoo now charges for services that were once free; Hotmail

WorldCom woes dominate, BearShare 4.0 isn't what it used to be,
and Jaguar runs ahead of schedule.--Laura Lindhe, executive editor, CNET Tech Trends
1
WorldCom:
I hate to put it first, but unfortunately, all other
   tech trends are overshadowed by this scandal. Now entering its
   fourth week as front-page news, WorldCom woes continue to sap
   investor confidence. This week's big story: the top execs from
   the company are standing silent against government accusations
   of wrongdoing.
2
BearShare 4.0:
This new version of the well-known peer-to-peer
   software was been completely redesigned and comes in two
   flavors: free with ads and paid without ads. This is nice
   touch, but unfortunately, 4.0 fails in one key area:
   downloading music. It uses the Gnutella client, but in CNET's
   tests, it had an abysmal success rate at actually returning
   files.3
Jaguar:
  Who ever heard of an operating system release being
   early? Well, Apple is managing to pull off the impossible; it
   intends to ship an update to OS X in August, instead of the
   anticipated late fall time frame.   4
Warcraft III:
Ah, summer: the perfect time to stay inside and
   sit in front of your computer. Warcraft III has just been
   released--right in time for the good weather. GameSpot calls
   it one the finest games ever made, but if that doesn't do it
   for you, there's another fighting game on deck (see No. 5).5
America's Army: As Senior Editor Darren Gladstone pointed out in a recent column, the Army wants you to play PC games.
   That's right: the United States Army spent $6.3 million
   developing its own title, and it has just launched a television
   campaign to drum up interest. Apparently, the campaign is
   working, since CNET users made America's Army a top search
   term last week.

"midmonth report : early warning - cera alert note : the following was sent out by cera and has a short term forecast of prices and alternate fuel pricing . note the price differential forecasts by basin . cera alert : sent wed , november 15 , 2000 title : midmonth report : early warning author : n . american gas team e - mail category : alert product line : north american gas , url : http : / / www . cera . com / cfm / track / eprofile . cfm ? u = 5526 likewise , a 5 percent warmer - than - normal scenario could decrease demand by 1 . 7 bcf per day relative to normal weather . fuel switching with natural gas markets this tight , there is significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the market . residential and commercial demand is inelastic to price in the short run , which leaves industrial demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the market . this winter we expect * all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an alternative to gas to do so * a loss of 700 million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day of demand for power generation relative to last winter * industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500 mmcf per day off of gas * gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil prices , as much as resid will act as a floor for gas for december cera expects an overall demand increase of 4 . 5 bcf per day relative to last december and a 14 . 4 bcf per day increase in demand relative to november , with increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel switching . supply - the rebound the pressure from increasing demand and lower storage inventories is intense , but us supply is beginning to rebound . the recent steep decline in us lower - 48 capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000 , given the soaring gas - related rig count . * the success in reversing the decline in the gulf of mexico is related to the combination of - the ramp - up of the hickory and tanzanite subsalt discoveries on the shelf , adding to the recent startup of the muni field ; these fields could add over 0 . 5 bcf per day later in 2001 - the response of the shallow water to the strong late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity * other important capacity additions are occurring in the deepwater gulf of mexico , with 0 . 5 bcf per day in 2000 and 2001 , and onshore , led by the bossier sand play in freestone county , texas , the barnett shale play in wise county , texas , and the powder river basin coal seam play . * further increases in drilling are likely to slow . new deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older rigs . producers are experiencing delays in obtaining rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling companies struggle to round out drilling crews . regional markets - wild winter in the west extremely cold weather in the west has brought rockies prices close to parity with henry hub prices and triggered early season spikes at sumas in the north and topock in the south . pipeline maintenance on el paso is exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has contributed to topock differentials of over $ 2 . 00 per mmbtu . tight pricing relationships to the henry hub in the san juan and rocky mountains should hold through february , with significant widening in differentials as heating loads decline . winter has arrived in earnest across north america , but the start - up of firm transportation service on alliance is delayed once again , this time until december 1 . nonetheless , flows on the pipeline are under way ; cera estimates that flows during october averaged 450 mmcf per day . during november that total should climb to 750 mmcf per day , despite the later published start date . with or without alliance flows , a weather - driven rebound in midwestern demand relative to november and december last year should keep prices in chicago at a significant premium to henry hub prices . in the northeast , differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to spikes throughout the winter , despite greater flows into the region from atlantic canada this year ( see table 3 ) . cera ' s outlook by region follows : * rockies . very cold weather within the region has brought rocky mountain prices near parity with henry hub prices . a break in the cold or a cold snap in the east will likely widen the differentials , but strong heating demand in the region will keep differentials within about $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu below the henry hub price . cera expects a december average differential of $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu ; however , this differential is expected to show significant volatility based on regional weather . a warm week in the rockies could still push differentials toward $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu . * san juan . san juan prices will continue to hold close to rockies prices through the winter , with significant pipeline capacity between the two regions . heating loads in the rockies will determine the san juan to henry hub differential , with extended cold weather in the rockies pulling both prices close to the henry hub price . cera expects the december differential in the san juan basin to average $ 0 . 20 per mmbtu . * permian and mid - continent . unlike prices within the rest of the west , differentials between the henry hub and the mid - continent and permian basins are likely to trade within a relatively narrow range during the winter , as supplies from those basins are pulled either east or west , depending on regional weather . cera expects a permian to henry hub differential of $ 0 . 11 per mmbtu and a mid - continent differential of $ 0 . 08 per mmbtu for december . * chicago . alliance flows into the chicago market are now running close to 750 mmcf per day . however , the onset of the heating season has offset those increased flows and pushed chicago differentials up to near $ 0 . 15 per mmbtu relative to the henry hub , despite delays in the completion of the vector pipeline . cera expects the strong pricing at chicago to continue , and december differentials should average $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu . * northeast markets . assuming normal weather , we expect to see december basis for new york relative to henry hub at $ 1 . 03 per mmbtu . new england will likely see prices $ 0 . 05 - $ 0 . 15 higher , depending on the pipeline . much of this increased basis differential is caused by fuel costs . for example , with a 9 percent retention rate from the gulf coast into new england , last december would have seen retention costs of approximately $ 0 . 22 ; at $ 5 . 70 , that same retention equates to $ 0 . 50 . despite additional volumes of gas deliverable into the northeast from the atlantic canadian fields , there have been no additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this gas to the local markets , and an additional 166 , 000 mmbtu per day of potential demand will compete for the capacity . because of this tightness , should this month ' s weather be colder than normal , we could see severe spikes in basis similar to those seen in january 2000 . these spikes could even exceed the highs seen in january , depending on the severity of any cold snaps and the extent to which new electric loads are realized . canadian markets - winter begins the colder - than - normal weather has increased demand in western canada but is only now being felt in the east . storage peaked in the west in early october at approximately 225 bcf below last year ' s level and 6 bcf below the five - year average . even with modest withdrawals since that time , storage inventories are still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs . easter canadian storage has continued to grow , pushing levels to over 245 bcf , 11 bcf above last year and well above the five - year average . with the eastward movement of the colder weather , withdrawals are likely to begin . this higher level of eastern storage will be useful with the expected reduction of flows on transcanada . the good news resulting from the cold is a more normal "" freeze - up , "" which bodes well for a longer winter drilling season . gas well completions are expected to reach 8 , 500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next year . further delays for alliance ? the "" commercial "" in - service date for alliance has been delayed until december 1 , the result of a combination of problems with clearing the line , delays in the completion of the aux sable liquids extraction plant , the delay of vector , and a lack of supply . the pipeline has been flowing gas , however , with volumes building up since september . it is estimated that flows for november will average 750 mmcf per day . transcanada has taken the full brunt of the alliance flows so far , with northern border and pgt remaining strong . december should see alliance flows build to between 900 and 1 , 000 mmcf per day , with modest reductions in flows on northern border and pgt . storage withdrawals will likely keep transcanada reductions close to 350 mmcf per day , year - over - year , until vector begins service to eastern canada . high prices : strong pull west the high demand in the pacific northwest has also provided strength for aeco . the aeco - henry differential has dropped to the high $ 0 . 30 s and low $ 0 . 40 s as a result of this increased pull . for december , the differential is expected to average $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu , for a resulting aeco average of c $ 6 . 97 per gigajoule ( us $ 5 . 10 per mmbtu ) . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this message with associated tables . cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"this isn't newsworthy...This is a forwarded message From: Declan McCullagh To: politech@politechbot.com Date: Sunday, July 14, 2002, 8:06:38 PM Subject: FC: Bush administration readies nationwide informant program===8<==============Original message text=============== The link: http://www.citizencorps.gov/tips.html---Date: Sun, 14 Jul 2002 20:59:54 +0000 From: ""J.D. Abolins"" Subject: Aussie paper: US planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen spiesAnybody ever heard of Pavlik Morozov? (If not see http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/morozov.html for a quick blurb about the fellow.) When I see proposals to mobilize American people into being eyes and ears fo the government, I am reminded of Pavilik and his family.Now I am not against people reporting certain things to the police. It is the habit of being constantly suspicious of neighbors, co-workers, and otehrs that can become destructive. Down the line it can lead to suspicions based not on significant clues but upon things such as ""fails to display sufficient respect for authority"", ""laughs whenever the phrase 'homeland security' is used"", and ""hangs out with anti-social misfits."" It is an all too easy slide from neighbors watching out for each and helping the community to becoming agents of the state.J.D. AbolinsPS: Why is it that the most revealing news reports about the USA are coming nowadays form the UK, Aussie, and other non-USA media? -------------- From the Sydney Morning Herald Web site 15 July 2002 http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/07/14/1026185141232.htmlUS planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen spies By Ritt Goldstein July 15 2002The Bush Administration aims to recruit millions of United States citizens as domestic informants in a program likely to alarm civil liberties groups.The Terrorism Information and Prevention System, or TIPS, means the US will have a higher percentage of citizen informants than the former East Germany through the infamous Stasi secret police. The program would use a minimum of 4 per cent of Americans to report ""suspicious activity"".Civil liberties groups have already warned that, with the passage earlier this year of the Patriot Act, there is potential for abusive, large-scale investigations of US citizens.As with the Patriot Act, TIPS is being pursued as part of the so-called war against terrorism. It is a Department of Justice project.Highlighting the scope of the surveillance network, TIPS volunteers are being recruited primarily from among those whose work provides access to homes, businesses or transport systems. Letter carriers, utility employees, truck drivers and train conductors are among those named as targeted recruits.A pilot program, described on the government Web site www.citizencorps.gov, is scheduled to start next month in 10 cities, with 1 million informants participating in the first stage. Assuming the program is initiated in the 10 largest US cities, that will be 1 million informants for a total population of almost 24 million, or one in 24 people.[...] ------------------------------------------------------------------------- POLITECH -- Declan McCullagh's politics and technology mailing list You may redistribute this message freely if you include this notice.
